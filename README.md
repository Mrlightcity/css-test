Project: Landing Page

After completing the CSS Foundations course in The Odin Project, I took on the Landing Page project.

To successfully complete this project, I brought the following skills to bear;
- my knowledge in creating and cloning a new repository on GitHub to git,

- my knowledge in HTML boilerplate and the use of DIVS as a generic box,

- my knowledge in CSS selectors, grouping and chaining selectors, color, background-color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, image sizing,

- my knowledge in the Box Model, box-sizing, padding, border, margin, display:flex, block, inline and inline-block,

- my knowledge in the flex-container, flex-items, flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-items, main and cross axes etc.

Thanks to The Odin Project, and its community for making this opportunity and resources available.
